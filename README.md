Python-midi-analysis
====================
The idea here is to decode midi files into objects that are easy to extract data from, primary by making tracks into objects that contains notes, which are objects themselves. 
This will probably only work with type one midi files which are organized so that each track contains data for a separate instrument.

(This isn't meant to create or manipulate midi files; it is just to get data from them.)
Current work in progress is generating note objects from the midi file, with start and stop times.
